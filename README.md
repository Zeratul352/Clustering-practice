# Unsupervised Learning - Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
This repository focuses on core Unsupervised Learning techniques: clustering and anomaly detection. The lab provides hands-on experience with K-Means for customer segmentation and a "from scratch" implementation of DBSCAN for anomaly detection.

### Task 1:
Segment customer data into k=3 clusters based on annual income and spending score using the K-Means algorithm.

### Task 2:
Implement DBSCAN from scratch to identify dense clusters and label sparse, isolated points as anomalies in a 2D dataset.

## Skills Obtained:
 - Unsupervised Learning Concepts
 - K-Means Clustering
 - DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
 - Anomaly Detection

This lab has provided a strong foundation in two fundamental unsupervised learning algorithms, enabling me to cluster data and detect anomalies, along with valuable experience in building and testing these algorithms from the ground up.
